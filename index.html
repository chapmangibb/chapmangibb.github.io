Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is the therapy of choice within the NHS, and clinical studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of CBT is enhanced when used in conjunction with hypnosis. 
However, I offer Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as a stand alone treatment, when required.

Hypnosis is a naturally occurring 'state' that combines relaxation and focused awareness. Our brains 'slip' into hypnosis, commonly referred to as 'trance' in our everyday lives - we just don't realize it! For example, daydreaming, falling asleep, or reading.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
Hypnotherapy combines proven therapeutic approaches with the benefits of hypnosis, put simply people are not treated with hypnosis but in hypnosis. It utilizes the natural trance state, by accessing the 'unconscious' part of the brain, where positive suggestions are employed to effect desired changes in behaviour, be it physical, emotional or psychological.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted  text-aligned">
Hypnotherapy is an active process, where you are not asleep, you remain IN CONTROL AT ALL TIMES, and cannot be made to act, think or feel anything that is not experienced as appropriate for you.

                    <p>
To write a paragraph on the contribution Carol Ann has made to my life is quite a challenge - really, I could write a chapter on the safety and comfort she provided me with when I was going though some incredibly difficult times. I first went to see Carol Ann as a lost and terrified 20 year old. She gave me the platform to discover who I really am and to find my confidence. I had no idea what a boundary was or how to say 'no'. She worked with me to allow my awareness to grow. Seeing what was actually going on in my life was the first turning point to make positive changes.
</p><p>
She taught me how to be kind to myself and with her support and encouragement I even went to university - something I never thought would be possible. My sessions with Carol Ann were always something to look forward to. She listens intently with interest and unbounded empathy. Sometimes I would cry my eyes out, other times I'd leave our sessions crying tears of laughter.
</p><p>
She is wonderfully adept at communicating, and when it was relevant, talked me through many well documented psychological theories, allowing me to educate myself and develop my understanding. To me, this wasn't just interesting, it was essential. And now, 5 years on from my last session, I still reference back to the work we did and use my experience to protect my safety and happiness.
</p><p>
Working on myself hasn't just allowed to me break free from the traps I had, and to be happy and confident, but also to be a more understanding parent, friend, partner and sibling. I would not be the person I am today and I would not have the life I have now were it not for the work I did on myself with Carol Ann. I could not recommend her enough. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h5 class="service-heading">Male, Fife:</h5>
                    <p>
I grew up with gaps in my knowledge and learning, mainly due to being emotionally abandoned by my parents at a young age, after their marriage break up.  Having no emotional support from anyone growing up, this left me feeling insecure and angry. Growing up through my teens and into adulthood, these issues manifested in me self harming and having suicidal thoughts. I had problems with relationships, and felt unfulfilled in employment, I was paralysed by fear. 
</p><p>
As an adult, I chose to seek help and support for these issues, that's when I met Carol Ann. A friend recommended her to me. Going to see Carol Ann turned out to be the best decision I have ever made, it was also the hardest. Being paralysed by fear and in the pits of despair, it is hard to imagine a way out, but there is. Going to therapy is a huge commitment and hard work, and becomes part of your life, however the rewards are priceless.  And then there's Carol Ann. I would imagine there are a lot of good psychologists and therapists out there, but Carol Ann is special, she's an inspiration and a revelation. I've never met such a warm and sorted human being in my life. It was because of this, and her skills and knowledge as a therapist that I was able to work with her over the years.
</p><p>
So years later I have done things, and achieved things that once I wouldn't have thought possible. I now have a BSc, I've done jobs that required public speaking, and I've also started a business, the list goes on. So if you are reading this, and thinking about going for a consultation, do it. You have nothing to lose, and so much to gain. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
I can happily recommend Carol-Ann as a therapist because she helped me see there is hope and light inside each of us that we can reach, even when we sometimes feel the darkness in the world reflected in our loneliness and despair. Through working with Carol-Ann I came to believe in myself again and find a way to repair the atrophy of abuse. 
</p><p>                        
Carol-Ann offered me kindness and empathy, whilst gently but firmly guiding me through a maze of familial denial and deception. Ultimately, she empowered me to enjoy a new life free from the emotional bondage of guilt and blame. Carol-Ann has a particular gift for finding the right way to help you as an individual. In fact, she inspires you to challenge yourself and by working together you will find you have built a bespoke set of tools that will secure you through the challenges of life.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="service-heading">Anon:</h5>
                    <p>
My life was not working well. Carol-Ann knows that after bad things happen, emotional pain remains. She persisted to find my buried pain, and encouraged me to face it, and process all of it. She supported me and never flinched at endless hideous revelations. 
</p><p>
My life is great now. Carol-Ann should be cloned and she could heal the world!
